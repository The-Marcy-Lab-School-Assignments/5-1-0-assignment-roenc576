# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Instance properties are defined in a class's constructor or prototype of the class, and when an instance gets created those methods/properties are created for that individual instance. 

Class methods/properties or static methods/properties are defined on the class itself using the `static` keyword, and once they are defined they are shared among all instances of.

Instance methods/properties are useful for when each instance needs its own copy of a method/property. Class methods/properties are useful if you want define constants across all instances of a class.

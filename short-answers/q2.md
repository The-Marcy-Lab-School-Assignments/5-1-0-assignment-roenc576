# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
One example of a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship would be a `Pet` class and an `Owner` class. Because an `Owner` could have multiple pets, but a `Pet` belongs to a single `Owner`. 

```js
class Owner {
    constructor(name) {
        this.name = name;
        this.pets = [];
    }

    listPets() {
        return this.pets.map(pet => pet.name);
    }

    addPet(pet) {
        return this.pets.push(pet);
    }
}

class Pet {
    constructor(title, owner) {
        this.name = name;
        this.owner = owner;
        owner.addPet(this);
    }

    printPet() {
        console.log(this.name);
    }

    getOwnerName() {
        return this.owner.name;
    }
}
```

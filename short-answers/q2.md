# Question

Provide an example a pair of classes that would create a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship.

# Answer
One example of a "has-many / belongs-to" relationship would be a `Pet` class and an `Owner` class. Because an `Owner` could have multiple pets, but a `Pet` belongs to a single `Owner`.
